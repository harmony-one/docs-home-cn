# Grant Proposals

We activates our community through our grant program to grow our protocol and ecosystem. Applicants can apply for grants to build core protocol features, developer tooling, and critical applications including wallets and financial applications.

## Ecosystem and Protocol Incentives

We plan to actively use our ecosystem and protocol monthly unlocking tokens, see [https://harmony.one/unlock](https://harmony.one/unlock).

Every month, our model **\*\*unlocks** 62 million ecosystem tokens **to boost growth in our applications and users plus** 92 million protocol tokens\*\* to boost growth in our developers and tooling.

## Areas of Focus

We will provide grants to decentralized finance \(DeFi\) projects with 1,000+ users and to wallets with 10,000+ users that are fully integrated with our mainnet.

Also, we will give grants to blockchain hackers to build BTC/ETH bridges and Truffle tooling and fintech developers to create identity and currency gateways that are fully integrated with our mainnet and SDK.
