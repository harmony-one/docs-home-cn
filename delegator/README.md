# Delegators 委托者指南

For those wishing to participate in staking without running a validator, delegation is the best approach to still get involved and earn block rewards. Harmony ONE holders can delegate their tokens to existing validators using our staking explorer: [https://staking.harmony.one/](https://staking.harmony.one/). If the tokens are delegated to an elected validator, a portion of the block reward earned by the validator will be credited to the delegator \(according to section Block Reward\).

The earned block rewards are stored in a separate reward balance of the delegator, which can be immediately withdrawn to the delegator’s account balance. The block rewards can also be staked again to achieve the compounding effect of staking.

Your delegated tokens are also associated with slashing risks of the validator. As a delegator, you should carefully choose validators based on their historical performance metrics such as APR, uptime and commission. In case of indifference or indecisiveness, you should distribute your delegations among multiple validators in order to minimize risk.

对于那些希望在不运行验证程序的情况下参与抵押的人来说，委托是保持参与度并获得大笔奖励的最佳方法。 Harmony ONE代币持有者可以使用我们的抵押浏览器将其代币委托给现有的验证者：[**https://staking.harmony.one/**](https://staking.harmony.one/)**。**如果将代币委托给当选的验证者，则验证者赚取的一部分区块奖励将记入委托者的贷方。

所获得的奖励将存储在委托者的单独的奖励余额中，可以立即将其提取到委托人的帐户余额中。 区块奖励也可以再次抵押，以实现抵押的复利。
