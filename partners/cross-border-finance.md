# Cross-Border Finance

We explain the WHY and HOW to justify the WHAT of the goals above. As we have been [since 2019 Q4](https://harmony.one/201912-milestones), the team will follow up with quarterly execution plans and milestone reviews in public.

**Why Finance**? Blockchains enable many marketplaces but banking services are the _native use_.

Consensus protocols are creating new economies with tokens and trading. Smart contracts are serving as a platform for collectibles and gambling.

These early use cases are driven by the core value of blockchain: providing exchange and liquidity infrastructure for financial transactions. Harmony focuses on broader _financial products_ as they are [well validated with Ethereum](https://harmony.one/defi-data) and ready for mass adoption.

**Why Cross-Border?** Open platforms _\_work locally but global users are the \_most underserved_.

Finance products within one country are already [highly efficient and protected](https://www.saveonsend.com/blog/money-transfer-china/). On the other hand, purely on-chain \#DeFi solutions without onramp gateways or local distribution have limited impact in real-word economies.

Harmony focuses on bridging high-growth economies in countries such as China and India, hence \#_CrossFi_ for cross-border finance. Harmony remains an infrastructure layer; our local partners serve customers with country-specific products and compliance.

**Why Harmony?** Not only fast and secure, Harmony is _decentralized_ and guarantees _privacy_.

Ethereum’s short-term pains are [scalability and security](https://harmony.one/keynote), which Harmony has solved with sharding and proof-of-stake. The long-term value of open platforms is decentralization, which Harmony has committed to with thousands of nodes and [_open development_](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-2019-year-in-review-8c852ef42668).

[Private transactions](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-will-happen-to-cryptocurrency-in-the-2020s-d93746744a8f), similar to secure HTTP for the Internet, are essential to businesses and corporations. However, governments mandate audits and compliance. Harmony solves this dilemma by bringing _auditable privacy_ to production.

**How?** We are customer obsessed but must identify the _right customers_ and _external values_.

The market [is divided](https://medium.com/proofofcapital/remittance-market-primer-and-landscape-3213c2c81771) into serving consumers or businesses: c2c \(cash remittance\), c2b \(ecommerce billing\), [b2c \(_employee payroll_\)](http://blog.eladgil.com/2020/01/products-i-wish-existed-2020-edition.html) and b2b \(marketplace payout\).

Platform protocols seek rent but must inject capital from _off the chain_ as revenue.

The values Harmony provides for customers, beyond open settlement, are forex _quotes_ and peer-to-peer _liquidity_**.**

Stablecoins and forward contracts can _manage fluctuations_ in fiat currencies; private matching can pool together local reserves like trades with over-the-counter \(OTC\).

In the [CEO’s keynote](https://harmony.one/keynote), we explain our commitment to decentralization and privacy. We will expand this article shortly to cover our top other two initiatives listed above: _decentralized development_ and _auditable privacy_.
